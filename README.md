# TCP-Congestion-Control-Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various TCP congestion control algorithms in Python. These algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing network performance and ensuring reliable data transmission over TCP networks.

This repository contains implementations of two TCP congestion control algorithms: BIC TCP and Cubic TCP. Each algorithm has two implementations: one based on a specific research article and another based on a TA PDF.

Implementation

Python is used to implement the TCP congestion control algorithms. Threading is used to simulate packet loss and timeouts.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- BIC_TCP
- CUBIC_TCP

Each directory contains:

Implementation files: Source code for the two implementations.
Materials: Research papers, TA PDFs, and other relevant materials.
Reports:
Log files: Detailed logs of each simulation run.
TCP parameters CSV: CSV files containing TCP parameters at the end of each round after simulation.
Figures: Visualizations of cwnd evolution.
Jupyter Notebooks: Additional analysis and visualizations.

## Installation and Usage

### Clone project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AminJml81/TCP-Congestion-Control-Algorithms.git
```

```sh
pip install requirements.txt
```
Then run any algorithm as you wish.

also you can run jupyter notebooks and analyze the algorithms data.

check project files and folders to get more information.
